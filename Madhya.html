	 "The Architectural Masterpiece"
	 </p>
	 
	 <p>
	 Khajuraho, a UNESCO World Heritage Site located in Madhya Pradesh, is known around the world for its stunning temples adorned by erotic and sensuous carvings. A small town located in the Bundelkhand region, Khajuraho is a brilliant example of Indian architecture and its culture back in the medieval period. The architecture of these Hindu and Jain temples depict the erotic forms of love, the carvings on the walls display passion in the most sensuous yet aesthetic ways. Built between 950 to 1050 AD the sheer confrontational nature of these carvings shows a stark paradox with the conventional Indian ideals about eroticism, leaving everybody spellbound.
	 </p>
	 
	 <p>
	 Art in this small town is engrained in all of its structures and are a classic example of the finesse of India's cultural and artistic heritage. The best part about Khajuraho is that although scores of plunderers tried to destroy the whole complex, they could never succeed, even though they managed to reduce the number of temples and caves to 25 from a staggering 85 at the time it was created.

	 "The Hidden Treasure"
	 </p>
	 
	 <p>
	 Orchha is a historical town located on the banks of river Betwa in Madhya Pradesh, known for its grand palaces, and intricately carved temples. Famously known as the city of palaces, it is world-renowned for the classic mural paintings, frescos and Chhatris (cenotaphs) that were constructed to commemorate the Bundela rulers. Orchha's old-world charm casts a spell on tourists from all around the world.
	 </p>
	 
	 <p>
	 Founded in 1501 by Bundela Rajput Chief, Orchha literally means 'a hidden place'. It was the capital of one of the most powerful dynasties to ever rule in India- the Bundelas. The major attractions in Orchha include Ram Raja Temple (the only place where Lord Ram is worshipped both as a God and a king), Laxmi Narayan Temple (known for its unique architecture which is a melange of a fort and a temple), and the Jahangir Mahal (built in hour of Mughal emperor Jahangir). The medieval architecture of Orchha's palaces and temples is a visual delight for photographers.

	 </p>
	 
	 <p>
	 Stradling the confluence of the rivers Narmada and Kaveri, the holy city of Omkareshwar houses one of the 12 revered Jyotirlingas. Shaped in the form of Hindu religious symbol 'Om', due to the merging of two valleys and a central pool of Narmada waters, it derives its name from 'Omkara' which is just one other name of Lord Shiva. It has two ancient shrines- Omkareshwar and Amarkareshwar. The sacred town also boasts of architectural wonders and scenic beauty, in addition to the pilgrim sites.
	 </p>
	 
	 <p>
	 The town of Omkareshwar consists of two ancient shrines- one is Omkareshwar and the other is Amarkareshwar. The holy town is situated on the meeting point of two rivers- Narmada and Kaveri. This meeting between two of the most prominent rivers of India leaves the island in the shape of Hindu symbol Om which is one of the most revered symbols by Hindus. The whole area is bounded by mountains and it makes for a very beautiful view. Kedareshwar temple is also a must-visit for all tourists here.
