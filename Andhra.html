	 <p>
	 Tirupati is one of the most culturally rich cities of India. Its proximity to the famous Tirupati Temple makes it one of the most popular destinations for pilgrims as well as tourists. Although the origin of the word Tirupati is not clear, it is widely believed that the word is an amalgamation of the two words “Thiru” and “Pati”. While Thiru means respectable in Tamil, Pati means husband. Thus, the word literally means “respectable husband”. The Tirumala Hills, which lie very close to the city centre, are ranked second among the world’s oldest rock mountains. There is no concrete evidence as to who constructed the Tirupati Temple, but it was controlled and renovated by several rulers since the 4th century AD. The temple has, however, successfully resisted Muslim invasion in the 14th and 15th century.

	 </p>
	 
	 <p>
	 Tirupati also survived British invasion and is one of the most protected shrines of the world till today. The legislature of Madras passed an Act in 1933 through which the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanam committee was given the power to administer and control the estates of the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanam through a commissioner appointed by the Madras Government. The Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanam was advised by the Religious Advisory Council on religious matters. The city of Tirupati was near Kotturu, today’s KT Road. It later shifted to the area near the Govindaraja Swamy Temple. Today the city has expanded to the neighbouring areas.

	 </p>

	 Besides visiting the popular temples, such as the Balaji Temple or the Venkateswara Temple in Tirupati, Varahaswami Temple, Tiruchanur Temple of Goddess Padmavati, Govindaraja Temple, Srinivasa Mangapuram, Avanakshamma temple, Tirupati, ISKCON Lord Krishna Temple, etc. Can also be visited. The Kapila Theertham is a place of worship dedicated to Lord Shiva; Parasurameswara Temple in Gudimallam, Kodanda Rama Swamy Temple, etc. are also interesting places around Tirupati to be visited. One can also visit the Sri Venkateswara Zoological Park which is home to several species of animals and birds. There is also Silathoranam, the rock garden which can be paid a visit. A visit to Tirupati is incomplete without tasting the special sweet rice and laddu. One should also not miss the local handicrafts which include woodcarvings, whitewood toys, Kalamkari art, Tanjore gold-leaf painting and most importantly the Chandana Dolls. The best time of the year to visit Tirupati would be the winters during the months of December to February.
