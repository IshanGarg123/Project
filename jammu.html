	 Situated at an altitude of 2730 m, Sonamarg is a mesmerizing hill station in the Ganderbal district of Jammu and Kashmir. Sonamarg literally means ‘the meadow of gold’ and with snow-capped mountains set against a spectacular blue sky, it is as close to heaven as it can get. The Sindh River flows through the valley. Ponies can be hired for the trip up to Thajiwas glacier, which is a major local attraction during summer.
	 </p>
	 
	 <p>
	 Sonamarg is also the base of a major trek that passes along several mountain lakes — Vishansar, Kishansar, Gadsar, Satsar and Gangabal. It is also the take off station for the drive to Ladakh across Zojila, a major pass in the Great Himalayan Range, through which the Srinagar–Leh Road passes. Sonamarg is also a base for undertaking the yatra to the holy Amarnath cave, during Sawan Purnima.

	 Sonmarg has ancient importance because it was a gateway on the ancient Silk Road that connects Kashmir with China. It provides as a base camp for Ladakh and is militarily very important for India. In the winter, Sonamarg becomes a valley covered in white gold thereby living up to its name.
