	 Haridwar is regarded as a holy place for Hindus, hosting important religious events and serving as a gateway to several prominent places of worship

	 The city is situated on the right bank of the Ganges river, at the foothills of the Shivalik ranges. Haridwar is regarded as a holy place for Hindus, hosting important religious events and serving as a gateway to several prominent places of worship. Most significant of the events is the Kumbha Mela, which is celebrated every 12 years in Haridwar. During the Haridwar Kumbh Mela, millions of pilgrims, devotees, and tourists congregate in Haridwar to perform ritualistic bathing on the banks of the Ganges to wash away their sins to attain moksha
	 </p>
	 
	 <p>
	 One of the most scared Ghats in Haridwar, Har-Ki-Pauri is visited by devotees and visitors in large number seeking the blessings of Holy Ganga by offering their prayers. It is the place where River Ganga flowing through the Himalayas touches the plain for the first time and that those who take a dip in River Ganga can wash off all their sins. According to the history, the place has a mark of Lord Vishnu’s footprint on a stone which is even present today. This is why, it is believed that Lord Shiva visited Har ki Pauri during the Vedic period. Constructed by King Vikramaditya in memory of his brother Bhartrihari, who it is believed had come to Haridwar to meditate on the banks of the Ganga, this sacred Ghat is an enchanting sight to behold with a plethora of temples at the river bank and golden hues of floral diyas floating in the river. The chanting of mantras and prayers with sages meditating exudes spiritual vibes and is an experience of a lifetime. The sound of gongs in the background takes one to an entirely different world

	 <p>
	 Rishikesh has been an important pilgrimage site for saints and Hindu devotees. However, it was in the early medieval period in India that the place began to gain popularity. During the 8th century Adi Shankaracharya, one of the most famous and revered sages from India, built several temples and ashrams in the region. Unfortunately, most of the temples and ashrams have been destroyed due to several earthquakes and floods that have affected the region over the centuries; however, some temples, such as Shatrugna Mandir and Lakshman Mandir still recall the rich cultural heritage of the place.

	 </p>
	 
	 <p>
	 According to one legend, the brother of Lord Rama, Lord Bharat performed penance in the place where today is the Bharat Mandir temple in Rishikesh, one of the temples built by Adi Shankaracharya in the 6th century. In the vicinity of Rishikesh, on the banks of the Ganges there are other, later temples and ashrams, attracting pilgrims from all over India
	 </p>
	 
	 <p>
	 It is impossible to speak about the history of Rishikesh, not to mention Lakshman Jhula and Ram Jhula. According to legend, Lord Rama bathed in the Ganges after the murder of Ravana, Lord of the island of Lanka (the ancient name of Sri Lanka), and Lakshman — another brother of the God Rama — crossed the river on the bridge, which he built with the help of jute ropes. So it was called the bridge (jhula) in honor of Lakshman. During the great flood that occurred in October 1924, the Lakshman Jhula bridge was destroyed, and was then reconstructed and reopened to the public by 1939. Another similar suspension bridge Ram Jhula was built in 1986 near Sivananda Nagar

	 Mussoorie, also known as Queen of the Hills, is among the most popular hill stations of the country. A Britisher, Captain Frederick Young, accompanied by an official named FJ Shore, had climbed up the hill from the Doon valley in 1827 and found this ridge offering great views and a salubrious climate. This visit laid the foundation for this grand hill station
	 </p>
	 
	 <p>
	 Mussoorie as a resort was established in 1825 by Captain Young, a British military officer. With Mr Shore, the resident Superintendent of Revenues at Dehradun, he explored the present site and jointly constructed a shooting lodge. Lt. Frederick Young of the East India Company came to Mussoorie to shoot game. He built a hunting lodge (shooting box) on the Camel's Back Road, and became a magistrate of Doon in 1823. He raised the first Gurkha Regiment and planted the first potatoes in the valley. His tenure in Mussoorie ended in 1844, after which he served in Dimapur and Darjeeling, later retiring as a General and returning to Ireland. There are no memorials to commemorate Young in Mussoorie. However, there is a Young Road in Dehradun on which ONGC's Tel Bhawan stands
	 </p>
	 
	 <p>
	 The best time to visit Mussoorie is during summers, as it offers respite from the scorching summer heat. However, if you are looking for a secluded holiday, come here during winters to witness the snowfall

	 Badrinath was re-established as a major pilgrimage site by Adi Shankara in the 8th century. In earlier days, pilgrims used to walk hundreds of miles to visit Badrinath temple.

The temple has been repeatedly destroyed by earthquakes and avalanches. As late as the First World War, the town consisted only of the 20-odd huts used by the temple's staff, but the site drew thousands each year and up to 50,000 on its duodecennial festivals. In recent years its popularity has increased still more, with an estimated 600,000 pilgrims visiting during the 2006 season, compared to 90,676 in 1961.

He originally enshrined it in a cave near the Tapt Kund hot springs. In the sixteenth century, the King of Garhwal moved the murti to the present temple. The temple is approximately 50 ft (15 m) tall with a small cupola on top, covered with a gold gilt roof
