	 Kochi is an irresistible tourist destination and is a must see at least once in your lifetime. This splendid city is a major port city of India and boasts of the mighty Arabian Sea as its water body. Kochi, erstwhile Cochin, comes under the Ernakulum district of Kerala. The name ‘Kochi’ owes its origin to the Malayalam word ‘kochu azhi’ that refers to a ‘small lagoon’, a very apt name for this port city. The city has been mentioned widely in the writings of ancient travellers since it has always been a favourite place of destination worldwide. In fact, many Portuguese are now well settled in Kochi and call it their home. Even now the city plays a major role in attracting tourists from all over the world.

	 </p>
	 
	 <p>
	 Kochi has a rich mix of both modern and ancient to suit the tastes and requirements of different people. This harmonious amalgamation of Western influence and Indian culture has given Kochi its unique identity. Nobody goes disappointed when he comes to Kochi because the city has so much to offer in terms of tourist places including historical places, centres of religious activities, museums, children’s park and, of course, malls for shopping. Nature lovers don’t have to be disappointed. There are sanctuaries and wildlife parks where you can check out the local flora and fauna. A visit to the Athirapally Falls will show you nature in all its glory.


	 </p>
	 
	 <p>
	 One thing that will take any tourist by surprise is the number of eateries that operate in the city. The restaurants and hotels cater to the palate of everyone. You can come from any part of the world, yet you can enjoy your country’s local cuisine in Kochi. However, it would be a shame not to try out Kerala’s local cuisine. The vegetarian as well as non-vegetarian delicacies prepared by the local cooks are mouth-watering indeed. While you are in Kochi don’t forget to sample the wholesome preparation of fish that is prepared by wrapping it in banana leaf. The pleasant climate of Kochi all the year around makes it favourable to travel to the city anytime. However, summer is at its peak in May, and the heavy monsoon showers in the month of August and September can dampen your spirits.
     </br>
The best time to visit Kerala is between January and April and between October and December. Accommodation is not a problem in Kochi and travellers can choose hotels and inns that suit their budget. Home stays are also quite popular in Kochi, and they offer a deep insight into the lives of the local population.
