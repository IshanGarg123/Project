	 Often referred to as a mesmerising "hamlet" situated amidst the lush green forests and surrounded by variegated mountain, Jibhi is just the right place to relax and spend some peaceful moments with your loved ones. An offbeat place in Himachal Pradesh, Jibhi is untouched by industrialization and surrounded by nature. The dense pine forests, tranquil freshwater lakes and pristine temples make this place worth visiting. You will be spellbound after visiting this place and would not want to leave it. The cozy Victorian style cottages in which you can stay are an added bonus that makes you feel as if you are living in the Victorian Period. So enjoy a cup of chai breathing in fresh air and listening to the sweet chirpings of the birds in the lap of nature.

	 <p>
	 Jibhi is a scenic, unpretentious and old Himalayan village settled on the banks of the gurgling Tirthan a river which is a tributary of Beas river. The architecture of the place speaks for itself. Constructed in an ancient Himalayan way, most of the houses at Jibhi are build of stone and wood. Apple orchards and Galgal trees adorn the backyard of every house in this Himalayan village.
     Jibhi has become fairly popular among Indian travelers in recent years. However, tourists from other countries discovered this treasure more than two decades ago. During that time, there were hardly any guest houses, hotels, or infrastructure to support tourism here. The village is still not too commercialized and only accommodation options you would find are Jibhi homestays run by locals.

	 <p>
	 Jibhi is one of the nearest villages to the famed Jalori pass, Sirlosar lake, Chehni Fort and the Great Himalayan National Park (GHNP). In addition to exploring all of these places, you can also indulge in angling in the Tirthan river. Or you enjoy the beauty of the village and the hospitality of residents. You can either make a dedicated trip to Jibhi or club your trip to Tirthan Valley with Jibhi.

	 "Trekking mecca and a virgin paradise"

	 Long winding roads and valleys that present unforgettable glimpses of cold desert and snow-crowned mountains welcome you when you set foot into Spiti Valley. Bordered on all sides by the Himalayas, Spiti Valley, located in Himachal Pradesh, has an altitude of 12,500 feet above sea level, and gets just around 250 days of sunshine in the year, making it one of the coldest places in the country.

	 The term Spiti means 'The Middle Land', as Spiti Valley separates India from Tibet. Scantily populated, Spiti is an adventure lover’s paradise, with a number of trekking trails that tourists can choose from. All of these treks start from Kaza (Spiti’s capital from where you make your base camp) to various peaks from where you can get panoramic views of the Himalayan mountains. An easy 1.5-kilometre trek along the Spiti River from Dhankar Monastery to Dhankar Lake promises gorgeous views of the villages below. The Dhankar Lake itself is a place where you can sit back and relax amidst the cool mountain air.
