	 Famous for its intricately carved temples and rock-cut caves, Mamallapuram or Mahabalipuram as it is famously known, is a historically important and well-loved tourist location situated on the Coromandel Coast along the Bay of Bengal, in the state of Tamil Nadu. Once the abode of the famous demon king Mahabali, Mahabalipuram was later renamed Mamallapuram. 
	 </p>
	 
	 <p>
	The serenity, the alluring atmosphere and the impressive setting with many beautiful white sandy beaches dotted with casuarina trees are all reasons as to why one would want to visit this wonderful town. Some famous tourist spots include the UNESCO world heritage site Group of Monuments like the Shore Temple and the Five Rathas, the Crocodile Bank which is home to some exquisite species of crocodiles and alligators, and the beach resorts in Kovalam and Sadras. 
	 </p>
	 
	 <p>
	Mahabalipuram or Mamallapuram was once a trade city that was established during the Pallava dynasty. It became an important port and was a flourishing and vibrant centre of activity. The Pallavas left behind a treasure-trove of history, architecture and culture in the form of stunning monoliths and rock temples, and sculptures dedicated to the Gods. The history of this town stretches even beyond the 7th & 8th centuries and the Pallava dynasty; settlements belonging to the pre-Sangam era and artefacts that predate the birth of Christ have also been found here. There is thus an air of mystery surrounding Mahabalipuramâ€™s history, with historians being unclear about the exact origins and roots of this popular tourist destination.

	 "Cape Comorin or The Land's End"
	 </p>
	 
	 <p>
	 Bordered by the three seas - Arabian, Indian and the Bay of Bengal, Kanyakumari is the southernmost tip of the Indian Peninsula. A small coastal town in the state of Tamil Nadu, Kanyakumari was earlier known as Cape Comorin. 

Kanyakumari offers the marvellous confluence of the Bay of Bengal, the Arabian Sea and the Indian ocean meeting together at a point. But, this is not a miracle, the miracle lies in the beauty that the water of three seas does not mix, you can clearly distinguish between the turquoise blue, deep blue and sea green waters of the three seas.
	 </p>
	 
	 <p>
	To enjoy the best view of sunset and sunrise, you can visit the Triveni Sangam point and the famous View tower.

The town has a mountainous terrain with elevated patches of hills, coconut trees and lined with paddy fields. Kanyakumari is also the only place in India where you can observe the sunrise and sunset at the same beach. 

The town is not only popular for its unique phenomenon but also its temples and the Vivekananda Rock Memorial among other iconic monuments.

Waterfalls in Kanyakumari that you should not miss out on include the Thirparappu falls, the Courtallam Falls, and the Olakaruvi falls. Kanyakumari has authentic South Indian cuisine, with seafood and coconuts being an integral part of almost all dishes.
