	"The City of Nizams" 
	 </p>
	 
	 <p>
	 A city of contrasts, Hyderabad exudes an old-world charm of its own with the Old City (Charminar side), Hitech City (Cyberabad) and the other areas lying between the old and the new. The capital and the largest city of Telanaga, Hyderabad is home to stately mosques and noisy bazaars lined parallelly alongside swanky new office buildings and malls, and it is these very contrasts – these glimpses into the city’s rich past with inherent promises of an even better future –that make Hyderabad a city worth visiting. Maybe even more than once.
	 </p>
	 
	 <p>
	 The city of pearls and biryani, Hyderabad is home to one of the most iconic landmarks - the Charminar. Translating to 'four minarets', the grand edifice is built entirely out of limestone and granite, with four minarets on four sides, each of them facing a different street. The Charminar stands in a labyrinth of lanes crammed with shops, markets, stalls and shoppers - one of the best places to shop for the authentic pearls and relish the tasty biryanis, skewer kebabs and haleem (the smorgasbord of food that Hyderabad is known for).

	 </p>
	 
	 <p>
	Located presently in the Indian state of Telangana, Secunderabad has been called the "Twin city of Hyderabad". The city, located on the northern part of the Deccan Plateau, was established in 1806 by the English as a cantonment after they defeated the Asaf Jahi dynasty. While Hyderabad has still retained the influences of the Nizam's rule in its culture and architecture, Secunderabad has a more English touch to it as it was under the British until 1948.

	The city of Secunderabad is divided from Hyderabad by the Hussain Sagar lake, but still forms a part of Hyderabad's Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC). One of the largest cantonments in India, Secunderabad enjoys a significant presence of an army as well as airforce personnel. As a cosmopolitan city, it is home to many communities apart from the natives, including many Parsis and Anglo-Indians
