	 Located on the Parasnath Hill, the highest mountain in the state of Jharkhand, in an inland part of rural east India, of the Giridih district of Jharkhand, Shikharji is one of the holiest pilgrimage sites for Jains. It is believed that here is where twenty of the twenty-four Jain Tirthankaras had attained moksha (in other words, freedom from the cycle of rebirth), along with several other monks which makes it one of the most important and holy sites for Jain Tirthas. Shikharji rises to a height of 1,350 m thus making it the highest mountain in the state.
	 </p>
	 
	 <p>
	 Shikharji means the "venerable peak". The site is also called Sammed Śikhar "peak of concentration." because it is a place where twenty of twenty-four Tirthankaras attained Moksha through meditation.[3] The word "Parasnath" is derived from Parshvanatha, the twenty-third Jain tirthankara, who was one of those who is believed to have attained Moksha at the site.
	 </p>
	 
	 <p>
	 Save Shikharji was a protest movement by Jain sects against the state's development plans for Shikharji. Jains opposed the plans of the state government to improve the infrastructure in the hill to boost tourism as alleged attempts to commercialize the Shikharji hill.[5] The movement was headed by Yugbhushan Suri, and demanded Shikharji Hill to be declared officially as a place of worship by the Government of Jharkhand.[6] On 26 October 2018, the Government of Jharkhand issued an official memorandum declaring the Shikharji hill as a 'place of worship'.

	 Located near the Taimara village in the Ranchi district, Dasham Falls, also known as Dassam Falls, is a spectacular waterfall in the state of Jharkhand which is a tributary of the Subarnarekha River. Cascading down a height of 144 ft., the waterfall boast of utter serenity, peace and calm. The area surrounding the spot is engulfed in rich greenery, that makes it an ideal picnic place in the region. To reach the spot, you will have to climb a flight of stairs. You can also stop in between and stare at the gorgeous scenery surrounding it.
	 </p>
	 
	 <p>
	 The waterfall is basically a Nick Point, also known as Knick Point, which means that it has been developed over the years due to the break in the rocky slopes in a longitudinal manner. For the same reason, it is not ideal to swim or to step into the water as the current is strong and the ground is uneven. Other than that, the region echoes with the gurgling sound of water which is like music to the ears, and is perfect to relax and rejuvenate.
	 </p>
	 
	 <p>
	 The best time to visit the Dasham Falls is between the months of July and March, especially at the time of the rainy season. During the monsoons, the place is engulfed in a green carpet and the water gurgles and flows in all its majesty and glory. You can also visit here during the winter season but the waterfall dries up during summers. So, it is advisable not to plan a trip at that time.
