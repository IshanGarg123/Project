		"The abode of bygone ruins, rusty colors and fascinating landscape"
	 </p>
	 
	 <p>
	 Hampi, the city of ruins, is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Situated in the shadowed depth of hills and valleys in the state of Karnataka, this place is a historical delight for travellers. Surrounded by 500 ancient monuments, beautiful temples, bustling street markets, bastions, treasury building and captivating remains of Vijayanagar Empire, Hampi is a backpacker's delight. Hampi is an open museum with 100+ locations to explore and a favourite way to see the city from the perspective of its history.
	 </p>
	 
	 <p>
	 Hampi was the capital of the Vijayanagar empire around 1500 AD, and by some accounts, the second largest city in the world at that time. Over the next centuries it fell out of importance, and now you can explore the ruins of a lot of temples and other structures spread out over a vast area. The terrain around Hampi is as mysterious as the ruins itself - the city is surrounded by boulders of different sizes, and you can climb to the top of them with a little effort to get a stunning view of the entire city and the geography. It is located on the banks of the Tungabhadra River. Famous for its massive, beautifully carved temples, especially the Virupaksha Temple, dedicated to the patron deity of the empire. You can also find remains of the old aqueducts, canals and military barracks and stables here. Hampi was declared a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1986 and many efforts have been taken to restore the lost glory of the place - very limited (if any) modern establishments are allowed in the main area, which gives an authentic feel to the ruins.

	 "Home to the Mysore Maharajas"
	 </p>
	 
	 <p>
	 Famously known as The City of Palaces, it wouldnâ€™t be wrong to say that Mysore, currently Mysuru, is one of the most important places in the country regarding ancient reigns. It is replete with the history of its dazzling royal heritage, intricate architecture, its famed silk sarees, yoga, and sandalwood, to name just a few. Located in the foothills of the Chamundi Hills, Mysore is the third most populated city in Karnataka, and its rich heritage draws millions of tourists all year round. The highlight is the majestic Mysore Palace, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, which is a must-visit.
	 </p>
	 
	 <p>
	 Mysore was one of the three largest Princely States in the erstwhile British Empire of India. To this day, the Mysore Palace stands tall as one of the most spectacular palaces in India. A very famous tourist spot that sees thousands of visitors milling in and around it every day, the Mysore Palace is a mesmerizing example of Indo-Saracenic architecture, every inch of the palace drips with opulence and intricate details, and every room that you visit stands out in terms of its elaborate architecture, beautiful paintings, rich colours and stained-glass windows. On every Sunday, and during the Dussehra celebrations, the palace is spectacularly lit up once dusk falls.

	 "Home to the World's Second Tallest Shiva Statue"
	 </p>
	 
	 <p>
	 Murudeshwar is home to the second tallest statue of Lord Shiva (123 ft) in the world. With the shimmering Arabian Sea on three sides and the magnificent Western Ghats imposing their presence on this town, it is a favourite picnic spot for the folks from Kerala and Karnataka. The beaches and the adventure activities around Netrani island are significant attractions for the tourists.

	 Murudeshwar temple and fort are also the most visited spots, captivating one with their rustic charm and beauty. Nearby Netrani island is also a trendy spot for tourists as it offers excellent snorkelling and scuba diving opportunities. The Murudeshwar beach, however, has become a little overcrowded and dirty due to human intervention and could be avoided.

	 </p>
	 
	 <p>
	 Located around 245 km from Bangalore, Kabini is primarily known for its handful of luxury resorts around the Kabini River and Nagarhole National Park in the vicinity.  Please note that there are not many budget-friendly accommodations near Kabini River. It is a popular weekend getaway from Bangalore, Mysore and Mangalore.

	 <p>
	 Once a private hunting area for the British, Kabini is a wildlife destination that is the largest place for Asiatic Elephants in the world. The Kabini Forest Reserve (which comprises the south-eastern part of Nagarhole National Park) is famous for its amazing wildlife and birdlife. Kabini is also home to the world's most famous living black panther "Saya". Even though it is not impossible to spot him, it is very rare.
